# FitCore Gym Website

A complete, production-ready gym website generated from a single-category prompt (Gym/Fitness). Includes three pages: Home (index.html), About (about.html), and Contact (contact.html), plus a README with setup and structure information.

How to run:
- Open index.html in a modern browser to view the homepage.
- Navigate to about.html to learn about the gym and team.
- Open contact.html to reach out via the built-in form (demo submission).

Project structure:
- index.html: Home page with hero, programs, testimonials, and footer.
- about.html: About page with philosophy, trainers, and facilities.
- contact.html: Contact form and contact details.
- README.md: This file.

Design and usability notes:
- Tailwind CSS CDN is used for all styling (no external CSS files).
- All images use descriptive alt text and placeholders (to be replaced with real assets).
- The color palette follows the Gym theme: crimson primary, black/gray backgrounds, and orange accents.
- Accessible and responsive layout with semantic HTML5 elements (header, nav, main, section, footer).
- Simple on-scroll reveal animation implemented via JavaScript with Tailwind utility classes.

Typography and assets:
- Headings use bold display styles; body text uses readable sans fonts.
- Placeholder images follow the template: https://images.pexels.com/photos/6576745/pexels-photo-6576745.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940.

Extensibility:
- You can add more sections or pages by reusing the header/footer components.
- To add more programs or testimonials, copy existing cards and adjust content.
